=>A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

**There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
The first character must not be a digit.

=>Examples of valid names:

let userName;
let test123;

=>JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const


**var=>
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.


**Let =>
The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with let have Block Scope

Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

**Const =>
The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

Variables defined with const have Block Scope


=>When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.
